ShootaGun is a 2.5D shooter based on Viewpoint for NeoGeo CD. On your way to the military base you receive an emergency signal from one of the most famous weapon factory in the sector, on the help signal thereâ€™s only one thing written: Shadow Hands.\nThis project was the starting point of my journey with programming, it started as a simple question: How games are made? And when it was done and the game was up in Itch.io I had only one thing in mind: I need to work with code.
