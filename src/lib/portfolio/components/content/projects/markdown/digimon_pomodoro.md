![Digimon Pomodoro](/portfolio/projects/digimon_pomodoro_banner.webp "Preview")

This project started first as a simple pomodoro app, but as I looked for ways to make people to stick with it the idea to add some sort of gamefication loomed over my head.
If I could put some sort of prize in the end of each pomodoro people would be interested in finishing it multiple times.
So I've decided to use <a href="https://digi-api.com/" target="blank">DAPI</a> and implemented a evolution system based on the pomodoro. Each completed pomodoro would lead to a new evolution based on the previous one, and every evolution that you get will be cataloged in the ```dictionary``` menu.
